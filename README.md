## Hi there, I'm Lukas Kilian! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Digital Business student at the Ravensburg-Weingarten University, driven by combining technology and business to improve the lives of as many people as possible.

I've used my skills in the health and fitness space to develop [mealie](https://www.mealie.de), a user-driven meal recommendation and food tracking app. 

Feel free to explore my previous work or message me to chat about mealie!
